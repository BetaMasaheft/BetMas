Exist-db application (without data)
This is at the moment not the master repo of the app. It is a copy for transparency and version tracking purposes, which reproduces what is currently online. Once the new version is ready and online, the code is updated here and the release note going with it explains what has changed. 
This is the code used by the app displaying the data of the project.
All js dependencies typically stored in resources are not copied in this repo
The data is omitted and is the one stored in this same group in the specific repositories.
