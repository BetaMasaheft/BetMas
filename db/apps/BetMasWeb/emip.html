            The Ethiopic Manuscript Imaging Project (EMIP)

        <img src="https://www.betamasaheft.uni-hamburg.de/15689924/emip-283972117599414bc765bb8ef29068fbe790ab9b.png" />
            <p>EMIP is one of the projects sharing metadata and images with Bm. For the institution record see <a href="https://betamasaheft.eu/INS0447EMIP">INS0447EMIP</a> and <a href="INS0027IHA">INS0027IHA</a>.</p>
            <p>The purposes of EMIP are to locate and digitize manuscripts of the Orthodox and Islamic communities in Ethiopia. To date nearly 13,000 manuscripts have been digitized.  These activities have led to further necessary work: to collaborate with others to create electronically searchable metadata for the manuscripts, and to make the images and metadata available to others. The culmination of this last effort is to load images and metadata into the XML environment of Bm. See Introduction to <a href="https://api.pageplace.de/preview/DT0400.9781725245037_A40374387/preview-9781725245037_A40374387.pdf">EMIP project catalogue</a> for the project history and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Ethiopic-Manuscript-Imaging-Project-108227949014/">EMIP facebook page</a> for updates. </p>
            <h4>Research Assistants, workers, and digitizers</h4> <p>Roger Rundell was a first research assistant for about two years. After him Jeremy Brown took up that position for several years until he left for a PhD program at Catholic University of America.   Brown, in particular, mastered every aspect of the work of digitization, image processing, archive management, and manuscript studies. He led the work of digitization, particularly in the Endangered Archives Project (<a href="https://eap.bl.uk/index.php/project/EAP286/search">#286</a>) of 2010 at the Institute of Ethiopian Studies, in Addis Ababa. Other digtiizers at the IES included Erik Young (at that time from Portland, OR), Ato Kaleab Demeke, and three MA students in the University of Addis Ababa, Hailemariam Ayaleu (from Lalibalā), Sileshi Kebede (from Western Walagā) and Makonnen Desta (from Addis) who we trained and hired for the EAP project.  After the EAP project was over (June 2010), Ato Hailemariam worked for several projects digitizing collections at a handful of locations in Ethiopia. We also trained Ato Kaleab Demeke who digitized several hundred manuscripts in Ethiopia for EMIP, working with dealers and in private collections. A host of students worked in various volunteer and paid positions to assist in digitizing and in processing the image sets (usually from hi-res JPGs into PDFs). These latter also took up small research projects and made presentations with Delamarter in various meetings of the Society of Biblical Literature. Recently, Delamarter trained a team of digitizers (Graham Abney, Jana Whitworth, Maria Hearing, and Trevor Shepard) who worked on manuscripts in the collection of the Mount Angel Benedictine Monastery Library in Mount Angel, Oregon.</p>
        <h4>Colleagues and Collaborators</h4> <p>Delamarter’s first colleague and mentor of sorts was Ato Demeke Berhane, past director of the Manuscripts and Archives Department at the Institute of Ethipian Studies. Delamarter and Demeke met in the course of Delamarter’s first trip to Ethiopia in 2004 when Delamarter gained an affiliation with the Institute of Ethiopian Studies as a temporary researcher in the country. Many joint trips and projects ensued, for instance, a tour of libraries with Ethiopian collections in England in 2006, and the EAP project in 2010.  Delamarter trained Abulahi Ali Sherif in digitization at the IES. He is owner and director of the Harar Municipal Museum and has a huge collection of manuscripts, particularly from the Ethiopian Islamic community. Delamarter introduced Abdulahi to Prof. Alessandro Gori and to Fr. Dr. Columba Stewart who have continued collaborations with him. Delamarter met Professor Getatchew at Hill Museum and Manuscript Library (HMML) in 2005 and spent time in Collegeville with him once and twice a year for about a decade, before Professor Getatchew moved to New York. Father Columba Stewart, Executive Director of HMML, facilitatied many projects with support of various kinds.  This included a commitment to host and preserve at HMML the image sets we were producing. At that time, Wayne Torborg was director of digital collections at HMML. Torborg taught Delamarter many of the skills necessary for digitization and project management. These skills were passed on to dozens of Ethiopians in workshops on manuscript digitization which Delamarter facilitated in Ethipia.  The first of these was a joint assignment with Torborg at the IES, to which Torborg brought the majority of the knowledge of photography and database skills.  In Washington DC, Alice Ogden-Bellis of Howard University School of Divinity worked with Delamarter and Brown to arrange the project at Howard to digitize and then catalogue the Tweed Collection there. After the Textual History of the Ethiopic Old Testament project was started in 2012, the work of EMIP and THEOT were often intertwined.  Colleagues in THEOT, Daniel Assefa, Garry Jost, Ralph Lee, and Curt Niccum, have assisted in one way and another to the work of EMIP.  For instance, Fr. Dr. Daniel opened the collection of the Capuchin-Fransiscan monastery in Asko for digitization, and Niccum opened the door for the digitization of the small collection of Ethiopian manuscripts at Abilene Christian University. More recently, Ralph Lee has headed up a team including Ashlee Benson and Jonah Sandford, to convert EMIP’s electronic metadata into XML to comply with the Beta Metsaheft standards and to enter these into their digital environment. </p>
    
            <p>The EMIP project assigns to each image set, a five-digit EMIP number.</p>
