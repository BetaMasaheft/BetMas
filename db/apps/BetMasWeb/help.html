                    <p>We will start from the navigation bar at the top of each view, then look at
                        contents of each of the menus in more details, discussing each list,

                                repositories we know of and, for each of them, a list of shelf marks
                                grouped by collection. If you know your shelf mark and you like
                                scrolling, this is where to look. The alphabetic navigation on the right may help you with the scrolling.

                                will then list the manuscripts from the database with some
                                information (more below). There are about 18.000 manuscripts, to load them all in this view will take some seconds.</li>

                                one of them will open a search for the manuscripts in that
                                catalogue for which we have a record.</li>

                            <em>Clavis Aethiopica</em>
                        </a>, an ongoing repertory of all known Ethiopic <a href="https://betamasaheft.eu/Guidelines/?id=definitionWorks">Textual Units</a>. You can use the provided <i>CAe</i> numbers to
                            refer univocally to a specific text in your publications. Please note

                               There use to be a link to <b>Documents Corpora</b> which since 2022 you cannot find anymore, this is still supported however and provides a list view from the

                    <h2>Lists</h2>
                    <p>We use to have several, different, list views for each type of item. Since 2022 this is not the case anymore. We have unified the results view to the one provided in the search. All former list views will redirect here and provide always the same visualization of the results.</p>
                    </div>
                <div id="itemsintro">
                    <h2>Items</h2>
                    <p>Item views represent one resource and its relations to others.</p>
                    <p>Some features are shared by most of the item views.</p>
                    <p>Under the navigation bar a list of optional views for the same item are
                        offered. These vary according to availability. For example, if no
                        transcription or text are available, this option will not be there.</p>
                    <p>There is always in this options bar a button called "Explore this page",
                        which will activate a short step by step introduction to what the page has
                        to offer. You find then a button to notify errors but also an edit button,
                        which will allow you to edit the entry in question. You will be prompted to
                        the GitHub file, which you can edit and make a PR with your changes. These
                        will be reviewed, discussed with you and eventually approved.</p>
                    <p>You find then some options which you can use to facilitate your reading of
                        the page, if needed, and show or hide the pointers from each linked entitiy
                        and the bar on the right with all related items.</p>
                    <p>There used to be a button to produce a PDF output from the entry. This functionality was never used, but when it did it slowed down sensibly the application, so, it has been retired. The scripts to achive the same are still available and have been improved as a separate package called Make PDF.</p>
                    <p>The following buttons are item specific and are discussed below.</p>
                    <p>The title line gives you basic name and references for each item, as well as
                        authors of the record and their role. Under it you will have a small item
                        navigation bar on the left, which can be scrolled and expanded for very long
                        entries.</p>
                    <p>The content of the entry is than at the centre of the page and organized in
                        different ways according to the item type.</p>
                    <p>At the bottom of the page you have also a list of possibilities to see related items, which
                        also varies according to the item type. You will however always have a way
                        to select one of the keyword associated to the current record and load a
                        list of records which share that keyword. You will also always have a box
                        for eventually existing public annotations made with Hypothes.is. This
                        offers you a very easy way to interact and enrich the data visualized, by
                        simply making an annotation which uses the tag suggested. We do not
                        currently support any other annotation tool, but let us know what you use,
                        and if it is possible we will fetch annotations from there as well.</p>
                    <p>At the right you will find the relations column with all relations
                        expressed in the current record and the links to the related entities,
                        grouped by name of the relation, for example, witnesses of a given literary work.</p>
                    <p>One last shared feature of the item views is the lower part, just above the footer, where you find
                        human readable and actionable links to the RDF representations and a
                        function to show all version of the resource and <a href="/pid.html">permalinks</a>. If you click on any of this you will see the data at
                        that point shown with the current interface, and the citation will be
                        updated with the information available then.</p>
                    <p>The four boxes below provide Citation, Revision history (which can be
                        entirely different from the version history!) and eventually present further
                        information on the attribution of the contents, followed by a licence
                        statement.</p>
                    <p>Most boxes are scrollable, and have a fixed height to manage better the space
                        available.</p>
                    <p>Every item view, as well as the individual repository filtered list also have
                        a function "Show Attestations", which will search for references to the
                        current record and list them with some context information, for example, for
                        a person, other persons which co-occur in the same context.</p>
                    <p>You can click on any linked entity to be brought to that item view, or click
                        on the little hand to load items related to that entity.</p>
                    <p>We use Alpheios in an embedded form, so that you do not need to install the
                        plugin. This means that any word in the languages supported can be double
                        clicked to load morphological data and definitions from Alpheios. We provide
                        Alpheios with a parser for Gǝʿǝz, so that you can double click on any word
                        tagged as Gǝʿǝz and retrieve possible matches with links to the Online
                        Lexicon Linguae Aethiopicae. Additionally, if you hover on any Gǝʿǝz word,
                        we will offer a series of useful links to a search in the database for that
                        word, a search in the dictionary, a search in the parser via its web
                        interface and a search in the <a href="https://www.traces.uni-hamburg.de/">TraCES corpus of annotations</a>.</p>
                    <p>Another function available from all items is the direct exportability of
                        bibliographic metadata, which are embedded in the page.</p>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Manuscripts main view</h3>
                        <p>The main item view for manuscripts will provide you two main parts: the
                            codicologial descriptions and the content description. You can hide
                            either of them.</p>
                        <p>At any place in the description, which contains a placement in the
                            manuscript for which there are photos, you can click to open a small
                            viewer at the location in question.</p>
                        <p>Information is organized by Codicological Unit and contents are grouped,
                            you will need to click on the button of an item to expand its content
                            and see the information available for it.</p>
                        <p>If a collation is available, then the codicological part of the
                            description will have buttons to display it, using VisColl.</p>
                        <p>Clicking on the title of a content will lead you to the Textual Unit
                            record for that.</p>
                        <p>Additional views which may be available for a manuscript are the
                            transcription view, the image view, the <i>Syntaxe</i> view and

                        <p>Landing on the main view for a Textual unit you will see the main title,
                            but also the Clavis Aethiopica number, the responsible editors and
                            authors of the record in question and the status of the resource.</p>
                        <p>The main content is in this view more straight forward, as it provides
                            the information availble about the text. If a text or even just a part
                            of it is availble, you will see a red button in the options bar just
                            under the navigation bar.</p>
                        <p>In the item navigation bar, you will also have direct links to the places
                            and persons list views already filtered for this work. This is different
                            from what you will get clicking the places optional view for a work
                            item, which will print on a map the places attested and marked up in the
                            given resource.</p>
                        <p>The witnessess section will contain links to manuscripts used for the
                            edition from which the record was created.</p>
                        <p>At the bottom of the main content area you will have, beside the
                            attestations button also a Voyant button, which will transfer the entire
                            data available into Voyant web version, for your further analysis
                            needs.</p>
                        <p>The relations bar on the right is topped by the list of manuscripts which
                            we know to contain the given work. A link is provided to see these in
                            the Manuscript filtered search view. Any Textual Unit can appear either
                            alone or as part of others and we will list here also those manuscripts
                            which contain a text which contains the current Textual Unit. For each
                            matchin manuscript we will tell you the name, linking to the record, if
                            there are images, and also extract some data about placement of the
                            Textual Unit in the manuscript, with the identifier of the item, the
                            placement, the position in the count of items, and if there is any text
                            available, a word count for it.</p>

                        <p>For manuscripts and textual units, you may have respectively a
                            transcription or a text available, more often just parts of either. We
                            welcome contributions in this sense, if you have content which can be
                            shared and has clear sources.</p>
                        <p>The text and transcription view is divided in three main areas, one with
                            the witnesses (for text), the area of the text and eventually images
                            related to it as well as apparatus, and the bibliography.</p>
                        <p>The navigation and indexes will allow you to call specific parts of the text according to its structure, using an implementation of the Distributed Text Services specification.</p>
                        <p>Each structural unit of the text may also have links to quotations of
                            that passage, to an alignment tool for different version and to
                            alternative versions if available. An info button will tell you more
                            about each.</p>
                        <p>If a translation of the passage viewed is available, you will see that as
                            well at the top as a separate edition and you may choose to restrict your text view to that only. If images of the witness manuscripts are available and explicitly
                            linked, the images of all available linked witnesses will be shown below
                            the text transcription and follow on with the navigation. There is
                            currently only one partial example of this however, and we hope to have
                            more in the future.</p>

                            their contents ordered by date. You will see the unit in question
                            highlighted to enable you to see where it occurs in the different
                            manuscripts. Under this you will also have charted information from the

                            available. Because the RDF only contains some of the information encoded
                            in the TEI, this is often nothing additional to show here.</p>

                            following <i>La Syntaxe du Codex</i>, namely a table to support the
                            identification of convergent discontinuities and a Sankey chart
                            summarizing the stages of transformation and circulation of a given

                            and their relations to the current one, as well a table of such

                            offer a Mirador viewer reading a IIIF Manifest extracted from the TEI.
                            This allows the creation of ranges which make the navigation of the set
                            of images easier, by linking a feature, for example a decoration to the
                            exact image. The information box in the viewer will also provide
                            additional information about the images. </p>

                            you to figure out what you can filter. For example you can search for
                            all encoded decorations of a specific art theme, or search the encoded
                            legends. If the decorations are present, but not encoded, you will not
                            get them in the results.</p>

                        <p>This map view, using the Dariah-De Geobrowser will extract from
                            manuscript records which have been explicitly linked to a Textual Unit,
                            information on their current repository and original location as well as
                            date. You will thus be able to see where are the manuscripts and in
                            which period they originated in which area. This is as always subject to
                            data availability, but if you are not satisfied with the data, you can
                            also add your contribution.</p>

                                <li>If you are searching for Yāʿǝqob, you will not have a lot of luck searching Yaqob, unless some kind cataloguer has actually added it into the data as simplified spelling form.

                        <p>
                            <a href="/newSearch.html">This new faceted search</a> allows you to search
                            for a term wherever it is, and then drill down the results, as in a
                            commercial website. Once your hits have been retrieved you can select
                            the features which help you restrict to a set of results. Beware,
                            however, because not everything can be indexed as text. if you search
                            for "Mary", you will not match all instances, but just those where Mary
                            is written up in the text. In most cases, this is not the case, as we
                            prefer where possible to use a pointer and store the name in an
                            authority file only. It is true that you will match that person file,
                            and from there you can navigate, and check occurrences and attestations
                            of a given person, for example. In this search, we are not trying to
                            give you sliders and similar things, or format the contents, or filter
                            out dirty data, you have to declaratively select among the available
                            values, for types of decorations as for dates.</p>

                        <h3>XPath search</h3>
                        <p>All searches are XPath searches in an XML database like the one behind
                            this website, but what you can ask in a XPath query is much more than
                            any of the provided search interfaces can offer. So, if you know how to
                            write your XPath, and know the source TEI (available for each file, by
                            appending .xml to the identifier of the record) you will then be able to
                            see your results listed.</p>
                        <p>Here you can avail yourself also of the structure of the file, the relative position of elements, and the 
                            nested elements, querying across the axes.</p>
                        <p>Examples:</p>

                        <p>Parallel to the XML, also an RDF triple store is maintained by the
                            project. Here you get an interface to the SPARQL endpoint. You can add
                            your SPARQL query and see the results available.
                            The endpoint can be queried from other visualization tools like Palladio.</p>

                    <h2>Citation</h2>
                    <p>To cite pages in the website, look first at the bottom of the page. versioned resources have <a href="/pid.html">long lasting links</a> .
                    If not, you have a number of other options depending on what you want to do.</p>
                    <p>Simply point to the general page (e.g. https://betamasaheft.eu/gender) or to one of the views (/gender/table, /gender/graph, /gender/page) or to the data at /gender/data. All these are stable links, they will not change. Their content will, these are not resources subject to versioning, like manuscripts, e.g., which can be cited using PIDs, but only visualisations of aggregates and queries.
                    </p>
                    <p>To cite a stable version of the specific dataset (/gender/data) which you used via its HTML view, so not the latest version and not that specific view, but indeed what you used in whatever way, you could save a copy of the data, in a format of your choice to Zenodo, and point to that dataset and its DOI,  which allows very easy versioning of the imported resources in case you need to update that deposit. 
                        The metadata would have to contain reference to BM as required by the CCBYSANC of the data, allowing non commercial derivates with attribution.
                    </p>
                    <p>If you want to cite the page as it looks when you are looking at it and with the data as it looks,  save it to the Way Back Machine with any of the available plugins and cite the web resource pointing to the version stored there. e.g. https://web.archive.org/web/20200812190615/https://betamasaheft.eu/gender/table/female, this adds to the declaration of when you looked at something the possibility to check it at that point in time.
