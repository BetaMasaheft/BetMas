                <p>Six Ethiopic manuscripts preserved in St Catherine are already well known to the scholarly community (Sinai Ethiopic 001-006), having been microfilmed by Library of Congress in cooperation with the American Foundation for the Study of Man and Farouk I University (1950) and catalogued by the Egyptian Ethiopianist Murad Kamil (1957). The collection has been recently expanded by one more manuscript (Sinai Ethiopic 007) which is a private gift.  Following the collapse of a tower and the ensuing restauration work, further manuscripts and fragments were discovered in the monastery in 1975. Ethiopic manuscripts had been mentioned summarily as being among them, but have been neither described nor studied yet.
                </p>
                <p>In 2023, Denis Nosnitsin and Dorothea Reule of the Bm project had the possibility to survey the manuscripts and produce a description of the entire Ethiopic collection. The description (and partially the images) of 15 manuscripts can now be accessed at <a href="https://betamasaheft.eu/newSearch.html?searchType=text&amp;mode=any&amp;reporef=INS0437Saint_Catherine_Monastery" target="_blank">https://betamasaheft.eu/</a>

                <p>In the course of the latest field research (<a href="https://www.betamasaheft.uni-hamburg.de/about/situation/fieldwork.html">November 2023</a>) it was possible to collect more data on one of the lesser known hagiographic traditions of Ethiopia, that of Yoḥannes of Wifāt. Yoḥannəs of Wifāt was a monastic leader who died in 1443/44. The founder of the monastery of (Dabra) Wifāt, he was a monk from the southern or central Ethiopia. As a a few other monasteries, Dabra Wifāt might have been prominent up to the 16th century, but disappeared due to the 16th-century Muslim wars and population movement. However, the veneration of Yoḥannəs of Wifāt continued in northern Ethiopia, similar to the cases of some other saints, such as for instance Takla Hāymānot and Gabra Manfas Qəddus.
                </p><p>
                    The first literary witness of the tradition was discovered during a field mission of the project Ethio-SpaRe as early as 2012, in the library of the monastery <a href="https://www.aai.uni-hamburg.de/en/ethiostudies/research/ethiospare/missions/mission6-2012.html">Rubākusa Giyorgis in Tamben</a>.  It was a manuscript from the 18th century. Now, a second, much earlier witness, possibly from as early as the 16th century, could be photographed in a small church of Qanaf Gabriʾel located in waradā ʾĀdet (Central Tigray).
                </p><p>It is not the first and hopefully not the last time that the field research by the Bm project has pushed further the limits of our knowledge of Ethiopic literature and Ethiopian cultural patrimony, and yields more interesting Ethiopic works to study.

                <p>The core of the project <a href="https://www.betamasaheft.uni-hamburg.de/" target="_blank">Beta maṣāḥǝft: Manuscripts of Ethiopia and Eritrea (Schriftkultur des christlichen Äthiopiens und Eritreas: eine multimediale Forschungsumgebung)</a> is a systematic overview of the rich manuscript heritage. The team encodes both the descriptions of known manuscripts from published catalogues and produces new descriptions for previously unknown and/or uncatalogued manuscripts. For this latter task, reliable cooperation with local institutions in Ethiopia and Eritrea and regular field and digitization missions to the research area are of primary importance. Among the areas of primary importance is the historical core of the Ethiopian-Eritrean civilization, now divided between the northern Ethiopia (the province of Tigray, where the ancient capital of Aksum is located) and southern Eritrea (Zoba Debub). The long-lasting tensions between the two states have so far rendered impossible active research on the Eritrean side of the border, yet fruitful cooperation had been possible for many years with the authorities of Tigray. </p>
                <p>The outbreak of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tigray_War" target="_blank">armed conflict between the Federal Government of Ethiopia and the regional Government of Tigray</a> in November 2020 collapsed many hopes of research projects and cooperation between western and local educational institutions. In the course of the war, the universities in Tigray region were severely affected and the universities’ staff was struggling for physical survival. This was happening not only during the time of the open warfare but even more so during the so-called “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/aug/07/people-are-under-siege-why-ethiopias-war-in-tigray-isnt-over" target="_blank">Siege of Tigray</a>” (ca. July 2021–the fall of 2022). In that time, neither research no educational activities appeared to be possible; universities and institutions in charge of the cultural heritage were closed, and salaries were not paid. <a href="https://www.fr.de/politik/aethiopien-tigray-buergerkrieg-felsenkirche-frieden-orthodoxe-kirche-92114999.html" target="_blank">Significant physical damage was caused both to academic institutions and to cultural heritage sites</a>. The partners of the project Beta maṣāḥǝft now found themselves in an extremely difficult situation.</p>
                <p>Extensive field research in the region which had been long planned in cooperation with the local partners to document the valuable manuscript heritage preserved in the churches and monasteries in Tigray, had already been put on hold during the coronavirus pandemic. Due to the military actions and the siege of Tigray, the travel warning of the Foreign Ministry of Germany was issued, making any travel into the region impossible.</p>      
                <p>Not discouraged by the appalling situation, the project found ways to achieve its goals by reorganizing its field missions and delegating tasks to local partners. Among other measures, the cooperation with the staff of Adigrat University has been promoted; a recent report has been published at <a href="https://www.betamasaheft.uni-hamburg.de/about/situation/fieldwork.html" target="_blank">https://www.betamasaheft.uni-hamburg.de/about/situation/fieldwork.html</a>. </p>

                <p>Thanks to the cooperation with the <a href="https://www.bmlonline.it/la-biblioteca/cataloghi/">Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana</a> and to the financial support from the Hamburg-based <a href="https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/181924784">Sonderforschungsbereich 950 '
                    Manuskriptkulturen in Asien, Afrika und Europa' </a>and the <a href="https://www.traces.uni-hamburg.de/">ERC project  'TraCES, From Translation to Creation: Changes in Ethiopic Style and Lexicon from Late Antiquity to the Middle Ages'</a>, in 2018 the Beta maṣāḥǝft could co-organize a mission to Florence, where the Ethiopic collection of the Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana could be digitized (by Antonella Brita, Karsten Helmholz and Susanne Hummel).</p>
                <p>In 2019 the images, alongside XML metadata stubs, were made available on the Bm website. They were subsequently aligned with automatic transcription acquired with the help of the <a href="https://readcoop.eu/de/transkribus/">Transkribus  software</a>, where a model had been specifically trained for Ethiopic by Pietro Liuzzo. The transcriptions (partially manually corrected) were also made available on the Bm platform.</p>
                <p>In 2023, Carsten Hoffmann carried out the cataloguing of the manuscripts, using the published catalogues by Paolo Marrassini as well as the digitally available images. The collection can now be consulted at <a href="https://tinyurl.com/BMLethiopic">https://tinyurl.com/BMLethiopic</a></p>
