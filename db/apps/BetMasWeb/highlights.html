                        <p>Among valuable and interesting manuscripts recently made fully accessible through the Beta maṣaḥǝft is <a href="https://www.betamasaheft.eu/manuscripts/ESdd041/main">Ms. Dabra Dāmmo ʾƎnda ʾAbuna ʾAragāwi DD-041</a>. This is the only monastic ritual manuscript known to be kept the monastery. It survived nearly intact and was recorded and catalogued by the team of the project <a href="https://www.aai.uni-hamburg.de/en/ethiostudies/research/ethiospare.html">Ethio-SPaRe</a> in 2014. The manuscript is a parchment codex of the size 160x160x60 mm, containing 104 folia. It was commissioned by the <a href="https://www.betamasaheft.eu/persons/PRS14617Zakrestos/main">abbot Zakrǝstos</a> and calligraphically copied by the scribe <a href="https://betamasaheft.eu/persons/PRS14616MalkeaKrestos/main">Malkǝʾa Krǝstos</a> (figs 1, 2). According to its elaborate colophon, it was completed in the year 253 of the Era of Mercy, the year of Matthew (corresponding to 1601 CE), during the reign of <a href="https://www.betamasaheft.eu/PRS10198Yaeqob">King Yāʿqob</a> (the first part, 1597–1603) and the tenure of <a href="https://www.betamasaheft.eu/PRS7829Petros">Metropolitan Ṗeṭros</a> (1590–1607). The manuscript has remained in use until recent times, as indicated by several modern leaf string marks inserted in some folia (fig. 3). 
                            A few historical events have been noted in a later note on the last folium (fol. 104r, fig. 4), in a form in part resembling the style and wording of the so-called short chronicles. The recorded events include the ascension of <a href="https://www.betamasaheft.eu/PRS8550sardaDe">King Malak Sagad</a> (Śarḍa Dǝngǝl, r. 1563–1597) to the throne in the age of 13 years and 3 months, the death of his mother <a href="https://www.betamasaheft.eu/PRS8276SablaWa">Sabla Wangel</a> in the 5th year of <a href="https://www.betamasaheft.eu/PRS8550sardaDe">Malak Sagad</a>’s reign, the death of <a href="https://www.betamasaheft.eu/PRS5112harbo">ʾazmāč Harbo</a> in the 12th year, the death of <a href="https://www.betamasaheft.eu/PRS7278Muhammad">Maḥammad (of Harar)</a> in the 14th year, the death of <a href="https://www.betamasaheft.eu/PRS10343Yeshaq">ʾazmāč Yǝsḥaq</a> in 16th year, and finally the demise of <a href="https://www.betamasaheft.eu/PRS8550sardaDe">King Malak Sagad</a> himself in the 34 year on his reign, in the land of Šāt. 
                            The manuscript is currently being studied as part of a PhD project.

                        <p>The Clavis Aethiopica is a comprehensive repertory of all known works of Ethiopian and Eritrean literature that provides a unique identifier and a reliable reference to each work. We consider a work any text with an independent circulation. Wherever a work also exists in other traditions, references to these works as well as to other Claves are provided wherever possible.
                            The current list of all works registered in the CAe (a work in progress) is available also at <a href="https://www.betamasaheft.uni-hamburg.de/texts/clavisaethiopica.html">https://www.betamasaheft.uni-hamburg.de/texts/clavisaethiopica.html</a>

We also include records for the important early works in Ethiopian and Eritrean studies.

                        <p>Six Ethiopic manuscripts preserved in St Catherine are already well known to the scholarly community (Sinai Ethiopic 001-006), having been microfilmed by Library of Congress in cooperation with the American Foundation for the Study of Man and Farouk I University (1950) and catalogued by the Egyptian Ethiopianist Murad Kamil (1957). The collection has been recently expanded by one more manuscript (Sinai Ethiopic 007) which is a private gift.  Following the collapse of a tower and the ensuing restauration work, further manuscripts and fragments were discovered in the monastery in 1975. Ethiopic manuscripts had been mentioned summarily as being among them, but have been neither described nor studied yet.

                        <p>In the course of the latest field research (<a href="https://www.betamasaheft.uni-hamburg.de/about/situation/fieldwork.html">November 2023</a>) it was possible to collect more data on one of the lesser known hagiographic traditions of Ethiopia, that of Yoḥannes of Wifāt. Yoḥannəs of Wifāt was a monastic leader who died in 1443/44. The founder of the monastery of (Dabra) Wifāt, he was a monk from the southern or central Ethiopia. As a a few other monasteries, Dabra Wifāt might have been prominent up to the 16th century, but disappeared due to the 16th-century Muslim wars and population movement. However, the veneration of Yoḥannəs of Wifāt continued in northern Ethiopia, similar to the cases of some other saints, such as for instance Takla Hāymānot and Gabra Manfas Qəddus.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The first literary witness of the tradition was discovered during a field mission of the project Ethio-SpaRe as early as 2012, in the library of the monastery <a href="https://www.aai.uni-hamburg.de/en/ethiostudies/research/ethiospare/missions/mission6-2012.html">Rubākusa Giyorgis in Tamben</a>.  It was a manuscript from the 18th century. Now, a second, much earlier witness, possibly from as early as the 16th century, could be photographed in a small church of Qanaf Gabriʾel located in waradā ʾĀdet (Central Tigray).
                        </p>
                        <p>It is not the first and hopefully not the last time that the field research by the Bm project has pushed further the limits of our knowledge of Ethiopic literature and Ethiopian cultural patrimony, and yields more interesting Ethiopic works to study.

                        <p>The core of the project <a href="https://www.betamasaheft.uni-hamburg.de/" target="_blank">Beta maṣāḥǝft: Manuscripts of Ethiopia and Eritrea (Schriftkultur des christlichen Äthiopiens und Eritreas: eine multimediale Forschungsumgebung)</a> is a systematic overview of the rich manuscript heritage. The team encodes both the descriptions of known manuscripts from published catalogues and produces new descriptions for previously unknown and/or uncatalogued manuscripts. For this latter task, reliable cooperation with local institutions in Ethiopia and Eritrea and regular field and digitization missions to the research area are of primary importance. Among the areas of primary importance is the historical core of the Ethiopian-Eritrean civilization, now divided between the northern Ethiopia (the province of Tigray, where the ancient capital of Aksum is located) and southern Eritrea (Zoba Debub). The long-lasting tensions between the two states have so far rendered impossible active research on the Eritrean side of the border, yet fruitful cooperation had been possible for many years with the authorities of Tigray. </p>
                        <p>The outbreak of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tigray_War" target="_blank">armed conflict between the Federal Government of Ethiopia and the regional Government of Tigray</a> in November 2020 collapsed many hopes of research projects and cooperation between western and local educational institutions. In the course of the war, the universities in Tigray region were severely affected and the universities’ staff was struggling for physical survival. This was happening not only during the time of the open warfare but even more so during the so-called “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/aug/07/people-are-under-siege-why-ethiopias-war-in-tigray-isnt-over" target="_blank">Siege of Tigray</a>” (ca. July 2021–the fall of 2022). In that time, neither research no educational activities appeared to be possible; universities and institutions in charge of the cultural heritage were closed, and salaries were not paid. <a href="https://www.fr.de/politik/aethiopien-tigray-buergerkrieg-felsenkirche-frieden-orthodoxe-kirche-92114999.html" target="_blank">Significant physical damage was caused both to academic institutions and to cultural heritage sites</a>. The partners of the project Beta maṣāḥǝft now found themselves in an extremely difficult situation.</p>
                        <p>Extensive field research in the region which had been long planned in cooperation with the local partners to document the valuable manuscript heritage preserved in the churches and monasteries in Tigray, had already been put on hold during the coronavirus pandemic. Due to the military actions and the siege of Tigray, the travel warning of the Foreign Ministry of Germany was issued, making any travel into the region impossible.</p>      
                        <p>Not discouraged by the appalling situation, the project found ways to achieve its goals by reorganizing its field missions and delegating tasks to local partners. Among other measures, the cooperation with the staff of Adigrat University has been promoted; a recent report has been published at <a href="https://www.betamasaheft.uni-hamburg.de/about/situation/fieldwork.html" target="_blank">https://www.betamasaheft.uni-hamburg.de/about/situation/fieldwork.html</a>. </p>
