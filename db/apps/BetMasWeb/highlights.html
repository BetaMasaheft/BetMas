                <p>Thanks to the cooperation with the <a href="https://www.bmlonline.it/la-biblioteca/cataloghi/">Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana</a> and to the financial support from the Hamburg-based <a href="https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/181924784">Sonderforschungsbereich 950 '
                Manuskriptkulturen in Asien, Afrika und Europa' </a>and the <a href="https://www.traces.uni-hamburg.de/">ERC project  'TraCES, From Translation to Creation: Changes in Ethiopic Style and Lexicon from Late Antiquity to the Middle Ages'</a>, in 2018 the Beta maṣāḥǝft could co-organize a mission to Florence, where the Ethiopic collection of the Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana could be digitized (by Antonella Brita, Karsten Helmholz and Susanne Hummel).</p>
            <p>In 2019 the images, alongside XML metadata stubs, were made available on the Bm website. They were subsequently aligned with automatic transcription acquired with the help of the <a href="https://readcoop.eu/de/transkribus/">Transkribus  software</a>, where a model had been specifically trained for Ethiopic by Pietro Liuzzo. The transcriptions (partially manually corrected) were also made available on the Bm platform.</p>
            <p>In 2023, Carsten Hoffmann carried out the cataloguing of the manuscripts, using the published catalogues by Paolo Marrassini as well as the digitally available images. The collection can now be consulted at <a href="https://tinyurl.com/BMLethiopic">https://tinyurl.com/BMLethiopic</a></p>
