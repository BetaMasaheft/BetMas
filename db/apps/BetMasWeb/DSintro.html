            <a href="/institutions/INS0478DS/main">Dayr as-Suryān Collection</a>
        </h1>
        <p>The project Beta maṣāḥǝft joined the efforts of preserving the cultural heritage of <a href="https://betamasaheft.eu/manuscripts/INS0478DS/list">Dayr as-Suryān</a> in
            collaboration with the <a href="http://www.thelevantinefoundation.co.uk/">Levantine
                Foundation</a> that has been sponsoring manuscript conservation campaigns at the
            monastery for more than fifteen years, and with Prof. Stephen J. Davis and the Yale
            Monastic Archaeology Project dealing with the cataloguing of the Syriac, Coptic and
            Arabic manuscripts of the monastery. </p>
        <p>It is well known that small groups of Ethiopian monks resided in the monasteries of Wādī
            al-Naṭrūn over centuries until recent time; they brought books from Ethiopia and left
            them behind in the communities where they stayed. The Ethiopic collection of Dayr
            al-Suryān represents only a tiny portion of the monastery’s manuscript holdings, but it
            is a piece of evidence that complements the history of Dayr al-Suryān with some
            interesting data. </p>
        <p>The collection consists of 23 parchment and paper manuscripts. The oldest Ethiopic
            manuscript, <a href="/manuscripts/DSEthiop3/main">Dayr as-Suryān Ethiopic 3</a>, dates
            to the seventeenth century (ʾArgānona wəddāse, ‘The Harp of Mary’). Other manuscripts
            are Psalters, Gospels of John, collections of prayers, liturgical texts, religious
            poetry, Miracles of St Mary. </p>
        <p>While staying at Dayr al-Suryān, Ethiopian monks kept transcribing religious texts in
            Ethiopic (the liturgical language of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church), Amharic and
            Təgrəñña (the spoken languages of Ethiopia and Eritrea) and produced a number of paper
            manuscripts. Additional notes scattered in the manuscripts help us to identify some of
            the owners. We know that in the first half of the twentieth century at least one member
            of the Ethiopian community probably came from the monastery of Māhbara Śəllāse (located
            in northwestern Ethiopia, close to the Ethiopian-Sudanese border), and another monk was
            from the famous monastery of <a href="/institutions/INS0354DB/main">Dabra Bizan</a>, the
            historical centre of the ʾEwosṭatean movement (today in Eritrea). The third one came
            from the city of Gondar, his name was <a href="/persons/PRS11905GabraM/main">Gabra
                Māryām</a> and he owned a number of books. Possibly he is identical to Gabra Māryām
            Ḫayla Māryām, the abbot of Dayr al-Sulṭān, an Ethiopian monastery in Jerusalem, of whom
            we know that he resided at Dayr al-Suryān for some years in the 1950s. </p>
        <p>Our cordial thanks go to the monks of Dayr al-Suryān for their collaboration and
            hospitality, particularly to the librarian Father ʾAmūn and the head of the monastery
            Bishop Mattāʾus, to Prof. Stephen J. Davis who generously shared his knowledge of the
            collection with us, and to Ms Elizabeth Sobczynski from the Levantine Foundation for
            making the work possible and for help in arranging the visit. </p>
