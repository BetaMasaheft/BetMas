            <p>Beta maṣāḥǝft supports some permalinks, and their use is documented in this page. The
                implementation is based on the consideration which can be found in <a href="https://doi.org/10.11588/ip.2016.2.33483">Eckhart ARNOLD, Stefan MÜLLER
                    Wie permanent sind Permalinks?, Informationspraxis Bd. 3, Nr. 1 (2017)
                    https://doi.org/10.11588/ip.2016.2.33483</a>.</p>
            <p>The implementation of this functionality was carried out during and thanks to the
                fruitful exchange during the Workshop Digitale Editionen - Auffindbarkeit und
                Referenzierbarkeit in Hamburg 11-12 June 2019, organized by Timm Lehmberg for the
                Union der Deutschen Akademien der Wissenschaften and the Akademie der Wissenschaften
                in Hamburg.</p>
            
            <p>The Beta maṣāḥǝft project guarantees the persistency of the urls starting with
                https://betamasaheft.eu for as long as possible while the persistent URLs in GitHub
                domains are guaranteed by GitHub.</p>
            <p>The format of persistent URLs is
                <pre>https://betamsaheft.eu/permanent/ [sha] / [rest of the url as in the website]</pre>
                The <a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/github-glossary#commit">SHA</a> is
                the same as in the commits in the GitHub repositories of the project organization,
                so that it should be possible to navigate between different permanent URLs of a same
                resource. However, the path to the file is not evident in the application, 
                although it is the very same as in the GitHub repository, so each link is reproduced in full, 
                for example

            <p>The persistence guarantee is limited to the underlying data as offered by the
                versioning in GitHub, that is to say that pointing at a given permanent URL the user
                will see the data he would have seen at that point, in the current context and in
                the current software visualization. All parts of the page loaded via external APIs or our current API will be at the latest state possible based on the selected version of the file in question.</p>
            <p>Not all URLs of the website can be cited persistently with a permanent URL, only item
                views, selected parts of the DTS API, and selected parts of the IIIF API. A search
                or a listing is not referenceable in a persistent way. It is possible however to use anchors in a specific view of the html, to point to a specific part of that version. For parametrized URLs which are 
                versioned in this way, also the parameters can be used as far as they are relevant to the latest specification for the given API (IIIF, DTS).</p>
            <p>The fact that the permanent URL will point to that item but in the current context
                (not the context at that point) will determine changes in the content viewed in all
                parts which are related to the context, which are many. For example, a title of a
                manuscript may not appear in the same way, as it is produced by looking in the
                database at the records for the repository and the settlement of the repository as
                well.</p>
            <p>On a simple item view, for any item, the button Permalink can be clicked to view all
                available versions of the file. For each of them three permalinks are offered. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>the one to the view of that version of the current file in Beta maṣāḥǝft</li>
                <li>the one to the view of that version of the current file in GitHub</li>
                <li>the one to the raw version of that file in GitHub </li>
            </ul>
            <p>For example, looking at <a href="https://betamasaheft.eu/LIT1349EpistlEusebius/main">Epistle of Eusebius to Carpianus (generic record)</a> and clicking <span class="w3-label w3-gray">Permalinks</span> a series of table will be loaded from
                the GitHub API, which correspond to each commit in the repository relevant to that
                file. The history is complete in as far as the data is elaborated in GitHub since
                the first day of the project. Each version has the date and time of the commit, the
                sha identifying it, together with the message left by the committer. </p>
            <p>This means that any committed version of every single file is citable.</p>
            <p>This list is not to be confused with the <b>Revisions of the data</b>, which come instead
                from <code> change </code> elements in the TEI files and document the relevant
                changes which the editors decided to record. These versions are all versions of the
                file as committed to GitHub, so, all versions which at that point were displayed on
                the application. Eventually it is possible to permanently refer to versions which
                are never been visible to any one outside the project before, since the application
                was opened to the public a bit later than the beginning of the project. </p>
            <p>Selecting the first of the links, the one starting with
                https://betamasaheft.eu/permanent, for example
                https://betamasaheft.eu/permanent/1c598017ca8ef92f62adaa659c129c6ee3e9a137/works/LIT1349EpistlEusebius/main,
                you will be able to see the record at the point, that is the one I committed on
                2017-05-12 at 11:46:02. You will find in this view only the content which was there,
                so, no text for example, and the <b>Suggested Citation</b> box , as well as the
                embedded metadata for citation which you can use to import, for example to Zotero,
                will also reflect the authorship at that point.</p>
            <p>In the main items view this <b>Suggested Citation</b> box will contain a link to this page
                and the canonical URL of the item main view (not the permanent one to the most recent commit), because you might still wish to just
                cite the record and not a precise version. It is however wiser to switch to the most
                current version, which is the one in display, and cite the permanent URL from there,
                if you want to refer to this version exactly.</p>
            <p>Note also the difference between the date of a given version and the date of access to the file. A reference to a specific version should contain two distinct dates, as the most recent version can be years old, or you could be seeing today an older version resolving one of the previous commits.</p>
            <p>If you are citing passages via the DTS API, or looking at a IIIF manifest, you might
                act similarly. While the latest state of the data is the one offered by the API, you
                can look at what the current version of the API would have returned based on the
                data at an exact version point. for example,
                https://betamasaheft.eu/api/dts/collections?id=urn:dts:betmas:LIT1349EpistlEusebius
                has now a citation structure, which it did not have at the given revision, at
                https://betamasaheft.eu/permanent/1c598017ca8ef92f62adaa659c129c6ee3e9a137/api/dts/collections?id=urn:dts:betmas:LIT1349EpistlEusebius
                Also the DTS API carries always evidence of all revisions of a file, to allow
                navigation between them inside <code>dc:hasVersion</code>.</p>
            <p>This allows to use a citation structure which has been replaced by a newer one
                consistently (although it does not allow to find out correspondences between the
                older and the newer).</p>
