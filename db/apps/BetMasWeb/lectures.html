                <h2>Remarks by Prof. Getatchew Haile on the Ethiopian Miracles of Mary</h2>
                <h3>23 May 2020</h3>
               <!-- <h4>PEMMgh</h4>-->
                <p>Prof. Getatchew Haile, perhaps the most important scholar in the world of Gəˁəz
                    literature, gave this talk on the Zoom platform on Saturday, May 23, hosted by the
                    <a href="https://cdh.princeton.edu/projects/ethiopian-miracles-mary-project/">
                        Princeton Ethiopian Miracles of Mary</a> project and Professor Wendy Laura Belcher. The
                    topic was the Ethiopian stories told about the miracles that the Virgin Mary has
                    performed for the faithful, in the Gəˁəz book called Täˀammərä Maryam (Miracles of
                    Mary), about which he gave many moving and original insights. Professor Alessandro
                    Bausi of the University of Hamburg, Prof. Kay Shelemay of Harvard University, Elias
                    Wondimu of Loyola University and CEO of Tsehai Publishers, and Prof. Habtamu Tegegne
                    of Rutgers University then spoke about Prof. Getatchew’s extraordinary contributions
                    to the field of Ethiopian studies. Prof. Getatchew then answered questions from the
                    audience. Prof. Steve Delamarter of George Fox Seminary was the producer of this
                    recording, which was edited by Elio Leo of Princeton University.</p>
