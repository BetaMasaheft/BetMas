# Betamasaheft counter app
---

## Why

The Betamasaheft application creates manifests that are later picked up to be filled in. Part of the creation process is assigning an incrementing ID to the manuscript.

## Resetting IDs

IDs can be reset by calling the `GET /reset-counter?value=1234` endpoint.
