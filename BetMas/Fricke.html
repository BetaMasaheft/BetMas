        <p> <a href="https://betamasaheft.eu/manuscripts/INS0904TF/list">The Fricke collection</a> is a small 
            private collection of Gəʿəz manuscripts currently held
            in Hude, Germany. The five manuscripts – three Psalter codices and two scrolls – were
            acquired by Dr Eva Omansen (1917-1990) during her stay in Ethiopia (1963-1974), where
            she worked as a doctor at the Ḫayla Śǝllāse I Hospital in ʾAddis ʾAbabā. We are very
            grateful to Dr. Treeske Fricke, Eva Omansen’s daughter, and her family for making this
            collection available for scientific description and digitization. </p>
