        <p>Beta maṣāḥǝft supports some permalinks, and their use is documented in this page. The implementation is based on the consideration which

                Wie permanent sind Permalinks?, Informationspraxis Bd. 3, Nr. 1 (2017) https://doi.org/10.11588/ip.2016.2.33483</a>.</p>
            <p>The implementation of this functionality was carried out during and thanks to the fruitful exchange during the Workshop Digitale Editionen - Auffindbarkeit und Referenzierbarkeit
            in Hamburg 11-12 June 2019, organized by Timm Lehmberg for the Union der Deutschen Akademien der Wissenschaften and the Akademie der Wissenschaften in Hamburg.</p>
            
            <p>The Beta maṣāḥǝft project guarantees the persistency of the urls starting with https://betamasaheft.eu for as long as possible while 
                the persistent URLs in GitHub domains are guaranteed by GitHub.</p>
            <p>The format of persistent URLs is <pre>https://betamsaheft.eu/permanent/ [sha] / [rest of the url as in the website]</pre> The sha 
                is the same as in the commits in the GitHub repositories of the project organization, so that it should be possible to navigate between different permanent URLs of a same resource</p>
            <p>The persistence guarantee is limited to the underlying data as offered by the versioning in GitHub, 
                that is to say that pointing at a given permanent URL the user will see
            the data he would have seen at that point, in the current context and in the current software visualization.</p>
            <p>Not all URLs of the website can be cited persistently with a permanent URL, only item views, selected parts of the DTS API, and selected parts of the  IIIF API.
            A search or a listing is not referenceable in a persistent way.</p>
            <p>The fact that the permanent URL will point to that item but in the current context (not the context at that point) will determine changes in the content viewed
                in all parts which are related to the context, which are many. For example, a title of a manuscript may not appear in the same way, as it is
            produced by looking in the database at the records for the repository and the settlement of the repository as well.</p>
            <p>On a simple item view, for any item, the button Permalink can be clicked to view all available versions of the file. 
                For each of them three permalinks are offered. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>the one to the view of that version of the current file in Beta maṣāḥǝft</li>
                <li>the one to the view of that version of the current file in GitHub</li>
                <li>the one to the raw version of that file in GitHub </li>
            </ul>
            <p>For example, looking at <a href="https://betamasaheft.eu/LIT1349EpistlEusebius/main">Epistle of 
                Eusebius to Carpianus (generic record)</a> and clicking <span class="w3-label w3-gray">Permalinks</span> a series of table will be loaded
           from the GitHub API, which correspond to each commit in the repository relevant to that file. The history is complete in as far as the data is 
            elaborated in GitHub since the first day of the project. Each version has the date and time of the commit, the sha identifying it, together with the message left by the committer.
            </p>
            <p>This list is not to be confused with the revisions of the data, which 
                come instead from <code> change </code> elements in the TEI files and document the relevant changes
            which the editors decided to record. These versions are all versions of the file as committed to GitHub, so, all versions which at that 
            point were displayed on the application. Eventually it is possible to permanently refer to versions which are never been visible to 
            any one outside the project before, since the application was opened to the public a bit later than the beginning of the project. </p>
            <p>Selecting the first of the links, the one starting with https://betamasaheft.eu/permanent, for example https://betamasaheft.eu/permanent/1c598017ca8ef92f62adaa659c129c6ee3e9a137/works/LIT1349EpistlEusebius/main, you will be able to see the record at the point, that is the one
                I committed on 2017-05-12 at 11:46:02. You will find in this view only the content which was there, so, no text for example, and the 
                Suggested Citation box , as well as the embedded metadata for citation which you can use to import, for example to Zotero, will also reflect the authorship at that point.</p>
            <p>In the main items view this suggested citation box will contain a link to this page and the canonical URL of the item main view, because you might still wish to just cite the record and not a precise version.
            It is however wiser to switch to the most current version, which is the one in display, and cite the permanent URL from there, if you want to refer to this version exactely.</p>
            <p>If you are citing passages via the DTS API, or looking at a IIIF manifest, you might act similarly. While the latest state of the data is the one offered by the API, you can look at what the current version of the API would have returned based on the data at an exact version point.
                for example, https://betamasaheft.eu/api/dts/collections?id=urn:dts:betmas:LIT1349EpistlEusebius has now a citation structure, 
                which it did not have at the given revision, at https://betamasaheft.eu/permanent/1c598017ca8ef92f62adaa659c129c6ee3e9a137/api/dts/collections?id=urn:dts:betmas:LIT1349EpistlEusebius
           Also the DTS API carries always evidence of all revisions of a file, to allow navigation between them.</p>
            <p>This allows to use a citation structure which has been replaced by a newer one consistently (although it does not allow to find out correspondencies between the older and the newer).</p>
