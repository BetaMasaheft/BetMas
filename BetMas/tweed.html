        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>André Tweed (1914 – 1993) graduated from Howard University Medical School in 1942 and
            practiced Psychiatry in Los Angeles for over 40 years. He was inducted into the United
            States Army where he served in World War II and during the Korean War.</p>
        <p>He traveled many times to the West Indies and to Africa. Beginning in 1950, he traveled
            several times to Ethiopia and accumulated a collection of 151 Christian codices and 78
            Ethiopian scrolls of spiritual healing. He donated the collection to Howard University
            School of Divinity in 1993, shortly before his death.</p>
        <p>In 2012, Steve Delamarter and Jeremy Brown (of the Ethiopic Manuscript Imaging Project)
            and Dr. Alice Bellis (professor of Old Testament at HUSD), digitized the collection with
            the support of a Lilly Collaborative Research Grant, acquired by Bellis. Delamarter and
                <em>Kesis</em> Melaku Terefe catalogued the collection over the succeeding
            months.</p>
        <p><a href="/EMIP02099">Tweed 150</a> is a 15<sup>th</sup> century copy of the Acts of Paul and the Acts of
            Sarabamon. In the course of cataloguing, it became clear both to Professor Getatchew
            Haile and to Ted Erho of the Hill Museum and Manuscript Library (HMML) that it was the
            very manuscript microfilmed in 1976 by the Ethiopian Manuscript Microfilm Library at
            Dabra Libanos Monastery as EMML Project Number 6533. Finding no good explanation of how
            the manuscript could have left the country legally, HUSD determined to return the
            manuscript to Dabra Libanos. With the assistance of Washington DC cleric and HUSD
            alumnus, Memher Zebene Lemma, the manuscript was returned in January 2016.</p>
