                    <h2>Lists</h2>
                    <p>Each of the lists accessed from the menu above is slightly different from the
                        other, here we will give you some of the features of each of these. The main
                        difference between these lists and the general search, is that these lists
                        allow you to filter according to some features, and search based on those
                        filters, while the General search will mainly look for text strings in
                        specific places. A second difference between the lists and the search is
                        that the results are presented differently. While some lists will give
                        specific basic informations (those explained in this section), some others
                        will contain all the content already and allow browsing and filtering (those
                        under indexes, below). The General Search (see the searches section) will
                        only offer a pointer to the resource matching the search parameters.</p>
                    <p>The lists views which are presented in this section share some features. On
                        the left side you get filteres based on the indexes for that type of
                        resources in the database, on the right side you will see, after searching,
                        your results as in a table, paginated by 20 as per defaults. You can change
                        the pagination option once you have done your search by entering a value in
                        the "how many per page?" field of the pagination bar.</p>
                    <p>In the filter section on the left, some filters are not loaded, because they
                        take too long to do so and are not always used. Each view will list them
                        just before the buttons to run the search. Check one and the additional
                        filter will load. </p>
                    <p>There are three buttons in the filter section: the search button, the one to
                        return to the list view unfiltered, and one linking to the General
                        search.</p>
                    <p>To get all records, run a saerch without setting any parameter.</p>
                    <p>Some parts of the inforamtion are loaded after the page is returned, they may
                        take a bit.</p>
                    <p>The color of the lines in the results is meaningful, it tells you immediately
                        if an entry is complete or not.</p>
                    <p>Once you have ruun your search, a bar with a summary of the results will
                        appear at the top, with links to additional list views for the selected
                        results and other actions for the entire list or for parts of it as
                        selected. Clicking on the hints button, will produce some additional
                        blinking buttons which will provide additional guidance on the content.</p>
                    <p>Both the available filters and the results depend on the list, and are
                        expelained in the below sections.</p>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Manuscripts</h3>
                        <p>On a selection of manuscripts you will be able to get a direct link to
                            the Charts view (see below), by selecting the specific manuscripts in
                            the list returned, you will also be able to get directly from this view
                            the PDFs, or to link to the Compare or Titles view for a selection of
                            manuscripts in your result. Checking the box at the top of the relevant
                            column will select all visible results.</p>
                        <p>Each result line will summarieze the formal name of the manuscript, the shelfmarks we know, 
                        the number of units, parts and hands, and the script. Some direct links to the source and some of the available views are also provided.</p>
                        <p>The values in the filters are also updated, so that the keywords available, for example are only those relevant for that selection, thus providing some summary information about the selection.</p>
