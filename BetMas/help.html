                    <h2>Lists</h2>
                    <p>Each of the lists accessed from the menu above is slightly different from the
                        other, here we will give you some of the features of each of these. The main
                        difference between these lists and the general search, is that these lists
                        allow you to filter according to some features, and search based on those
                        filters, while the General search will mainly look for text strings in
                        specific places. A second difference between the lists and the search is
                        that the results are presented differently. While some lists will give
                        specific basic informations (those explained in this section), some others
                        will contain all the content already and allow browsing and filtering (those
                        under indexes, below). The General Search (see the searches section) will
                        only offer a pointer to the resource matching the search parameters.</p>
                    <p>The lists views which are presented in this section share some features. On
                        the left side you get filters based on the indexes for that type of
                        resources in the database, on the right side you will see, after searching,
                        your results as in a table, paginated by 20 as per defaults. You can change
                        the pagination option once you have done your search by entering a value in
                        the "how many per page?" field of the pagination bar.</p>
                    <p>In the filter section on the left, some filters are not loaded, because they
                        take too long to do so and are not always used. Each view will list them
                        just before the buttons to run the search. Check one and the additional
                        filter will load. </p>
                    <p>There are three buttons in the filter section: the search button, the one to
                        return to the list view unfiltered, and one linking to the General
                        search.</p>
                    <p>To get all records, run a search without setting any parameter.</p>
                    <p>Some parts of the information are loaded after the page is returned, they may
                        take a bit.</p>
                    <p>The color of the lines in the results is meaningful, it tells you immediately
                        if an entry is complete or not.</p>
                    <p>Once you have run your search, a bar with a summary of the results will
                        appear at the top, with links to additional list views for the selected
                        results and other actions for the entire list or for parts of it as
                        selected. Clicking on the hints button, will produce some additional
                        blinking buttons which will provide additional guidance on the content.</p>
                    <p>Both the available filters and the results depend on the list, and are
                        explained in the below sections.</p>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Manuscripts</h3>
                        <p>On a selection of manuscripts you will be able to get a direct link to
                            the Charts view (see below), by selecting the specific manuscripts in
                            the list returned, you will also be able to get directly from this view
                            the PDFs, or to link to the Compare or Titles view for a selection of
                            manuscripts in your result. Checking the box at the top of the relevant
                            column will select all visible results.</p>
                        <p>Each result line will summarize the formal name of the manuscript, the
                            shelf marks we know, the number of units, parts and hands, and the
                            script. Some direct links to the source and some of the available views
                            are also provided.</p>
                        <p>The values in the filters are also updated, so that the keywords
                            available, for example are only those relevant for that selection, thus
                            providing some summary information about the selection.</p>
                        <p>Note that searching the <em>name</em> field will search the shelf marks
                            of the manuscripts.</p>
                        <p>Examples:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <a href="/manuscripts/list?qn=10%2C10">manuscripts composed of 10 quires</a>

                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Textual Units (Clavis)</h3>
                        <p>While the filters are organized in a similar way to those in the
                            Manuscript filtered search.</p>
                        <p>Clicking on the Voyant button in the top bar will transfer the entire
                            text of the Textual Units in the selection to the web version of Voyant
                            for full text analysis.</p>
                        <p>The results contain similarly some summary information about each Textual
                            Unit (Work). The first column contain the Clavis Aethiopica identifier
                            and a small table with corresponding identifiers for the same work from
                            other Clavis.</p>
                        <p>In the titles column, which links to the record, all available titles are
                            listed. while in authors all authors are listed, with a yellow
                            highlighting in case of attributed authors.</p>
                        <p>As in the manuscript filtered search, you can select several entries or
                            all the visible ones to print them as PDFs or send them to the
                            manuscript map. This means that if from your selection you want to see
                            on the map the locations of the manuscripts of two or more manuscripts,
                            this is where to start, especially if you do not know the identifiers.
                            If you for example search for "Miracle of Mary" you can select a series
                            of miracles and see on a map for each miracle the manuscripts we know of
                            in the ethiopic tradition which contain it, and see the distribution of
                            each compared to the other. This is of course always limited to data
                            availability!</p>
                        <p>The witnesses section will also list the available manuscripts with a
                            direct link to them, and link directly to the comparison or map of
                            manuscripts view.</p>
                        <p>Note that searching the <em>name</em> field will search in the titles of
                            the Textual units only.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Places</h3>
                        <p>The specific features of this list view are only that the results will
                            also tell you if there is a Wikidata correspondence.</p>
                        <p>This data, as most of the data about Textual Units and Persons was
                            extracted from the indexes of the Encyclopaedia Aethiopica, in Volume 5,
                            and are still very much like that index. As we work through the data we
                            correct and fix but there will always remain some inconsistencies.</p>
                        <p>Note that searching the <em>name</em> field will search in the place
                            names of the place record only.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Persons</h3>
                        <p>This filtered list as the previous has no specific feature, it simply
                            returns some basic information about each person from a filtered
                            search.</p>
                        <p>Note that searching the <em>name</em> field will search in the personal
                            names of the person record only.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Repositories</h3>
                        <p>The repositories filtered list will allow you to search across the
                            repositories registered in the database, and return information exactly
                            like the places filtered search. However there is a peculiarity here,
                            and this is that the link to the repository will not lead you to an item
                            view, but to an individual Repository view.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Manuscripts in a place</h3>
                        <p>
                            <a href="/place/list?place="/>
                        </p>
                        </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Individual Repository</h3>
                        <p>The Individual Repository view blends in one page the information about
                            the institution which we have, on the left side, which reproduce the
                            same format as the place item view, and a list view identical to the
                            manuscript filtered search view, but for space reasons, the filters are
                            on the right and are already relevant to the manuscripts linked to that
                            repository only.</p>
                        <p>You also get as a feature of the item view the bottom section with the
                            citation, revision and attribution boxes.</p>
                        <p>Clicking the Images button in the top bar will prompt a mirador viewer
                            with the available images, if any, for that repository.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Authority files</h3>
                        <p>The list view for the database records which are linked to values in the
                                <a href="https://betamasaheft.eu/Guidelines/?id=authority-files">taxonomy</a> are provided without the ability to filter a search
                            within these records. This may be offered in the future but the current
                            data does not offer any useful feature here.</p>
                        <p>Instead, the organization of the terms in the taxonomy is reproduced to
                            be browsed on the left. Clicking on each Category will pop-up its
                            subcategories and clicking on the categories in there will produce a
                            view of the entry followed by a list of all records which have that
                            keyword associated to them. You can then either click on the title to go
                            to the item view of that authority file, or on any of the resources
                            associated to it. </p>
                        <p>This means also that if you want to saerch for records which have two
                            keywords or more, this is not the place for you to start your search,
                            you should use either one of the filtered searches or the General
                            Search.</p>

                        <p>From a filtered list of manuscripts you can switch to a Chart view, where
                            instead of the tabular information, some charts which use some of the
                            data available in the selected records are offered. The same charts are
                            also provided in the Comparison view.</p>

                    <h2>Items</h2>
                    <p>Item views represent one resource and its relations to others.</p>
                    <p>Some features are shared by most of the item views.</p>
                    <p>Under the navigation bar a list of optional views for the same item are
                        offered. These vary according to availability. For example, if no
                        transcription or text are available, this option will not be there.</p>
                    <p>There is always in this options bar a button called "Explore this page",
                        which will activate a short step by step introduction to what the page has
                        to offer. You find then a button to notify errors but also an edit button,
                        which will allow you to edit the entry in question. You will be prompted to
                        the GitHub file, which you can edit and make a PR with your changes. These
                        will be reviewed, discussed with you and eventually approved.</p>
                    <p>You find then some options which you can use to facilitate your reading of
                        the page, if needed, and show or hide the pointers from each linked entitiy
                        and the bar on the right with all related items.</p>
                    <p>You find then a button to produce a PDF output from the entry and a button to
                        the main entry, as well as one which will produce an enriched TEI file.</p>
                    <p>The following buttons are item specific and are discussed below.</p>
                    <p>The title line gives you basic name and references for each item, as well as
                        authors of the record and their role. Under it you will have a small item
                        navigation bar on the left, which can be scrolled and expanded for very long
                        entries.</p>
                    <p>The content of the entry is than at the centre of the page and organized in
                        different ways according to the item type.</p>
                    <p>On the right you have a list of possibilities to see related items, which
                        also varies according to the item type. You will however always have a way
                        to select one of the keyword associated to the current record and load a
                        list of records which share that keyword. You will also always have a box
                        for eventually existing public annotations made with Hypothes.is. This
                        offers you a very easy way to interact and enrich the data visualized, by
                        simply making an annotation which uses the tag suggested. We do not
                        currently support any other annotation tool, but let us know what you use,
                        and if it is possible we will fetch annotations from there as well.</p>
                    <p>always in the relations column on the right you will find all relations
                        expressed in the current record and the links to the related entities,
                        grouped by name of the relation.</p>
                    <p>One last shared feature of the item views is the bottom part, where you find
                        human readable and actionable links to the RDF representations and a
                        function to show all version of the resource and <a href="/pid.html">permalinks</a>. If you click on any of this you will see the data at
                        that point shown with the current interface, and the citation will be
                        updated with the information available then.</p>
                    <p>The four boxes below provide Citation, Revision history (which can be
                        entirely different from the version history!) and eventually present further
                        information on the attribution of the contents, followed by a licence
                        statement.</p>
                    <p>Most boxes are scrollable, and have a fixed height to manage better the space
                        available.</p>
                    <p>Every item view, as well as the individual repository filtered list also have
                        a function "Show Attestations", which will search for references to the
                        current record and list them with some context information, for example, for
                        a person, other persons which cooccur in the same context.</p>
                    <p>You can click on any linked entity to be brought to that item view, or click
                        on the little hand to load items related to that entity.</p>
                    <p>We use Alpheios in an embedded form, so that you do not need to install the
                        plugin. This means that any word in the languages supported can be double
                        clicked to load morphological data and definitions from Alpheios. We provide
                        Alpheios with a parser for Gǝʿǝz, so that you can double click on any word
                        tagged as Gǝʿǝz and retrieve possible matches with links to the Online
                        Lexicon Linguae Aethiopicae. Additionally, if you hover on any Gǝʿǝz word,
                        we will offer a series of useful links to a search in the database for that
                        word, a search in the dictionary, a search in the parser via its web
                        interface and a search in the <a href="https://www.traces.uni-hamburg.de/">TraCES corpus of annotations</a>.</p>
                    <p>Another function available from all items is the direct exportability of
                        bibliographic metadata, which are embedded in the page.</p>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Manuscripts main view</h3>
                        <p>The main item view for manuscripts will provide you two main parts: the
                            codicologial descriptions and the content description. You can hide
                            either of them.</p>
                        <p>At any place in the description, which contains a placement in the
                            manuscript for which there are photos, you can click to open a small
                            viewer at the location in question.</p>
                        <p>Information is organized by Codicological Unit and contents are grouped,
                            you will need to click on the button of an item to expand its content
                            and see the information available for it.</p>
                        <p>If a collation is available, then the codicological part of the
                            description will have buttons to display it, using VisColl.</p>
                        <p>Clicking on the title of a content will lead you to the Textual Unit
                            record for that.</p>
                        <p>Additional views which may be available for a manuscript are the
                            transcription view, the image view, the <i>Syntaxe</i> view and
                            relations view, all detailed below.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Textual and Narrative Units main view</h3>
                        <p>Landing on the main view for a Textual unit you will see the main title,
                            but also the Clavis Aethiopica number, the responsible editors and
                            authors of the record in question and the status of the resource.</p>
                        <p>The main content is in this view more straight forward, as it provides
                            the information availble about the text. If a text or even just a part
                            of it is availble, you will see a red button in the options bar just
                            under the navigation bar.</p>
                        <p>In the item navigation bar, you will also have direct links to the places
                            and persons list views already filtered for this work. This is different
                            from what you will get clicking the places optional view for a work
                            item, which will print on a map the places attested and marked up in the
                            given resource.</p>
                        <p>The witnessess section will contain links to manuscripts used for the
                            edition from which the record was created.</p>
                        <p>At the bottom of the main content area you will have, beside the
                            attestations button also a Voyant button, which will transfer the entire
                            data available into Voyant web version, for your further analysis
                            needs.</p>
                        <p>The relations bar on the right is topped by the list of manuscripts which
                            we know to contain the given work. A link is provided to see these in
                            the Manuscript filtered search view. Any Textual Unit can appear either
                            alone or as part of others and we will list here also those manuscripts
                            which contain a text which contains the current Textual Unit. For each
                            matchin manuscript we will tell you the name, linking to the record, if
                            there are images, and also extract some data about placement of the
                            Textual Unit in the manuscript, with the identifier of the item, the
                            placement, the position in the count of items, and if there is any text
                            available, a word count for it.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Places main view</h3>
                        <p>The item view for places features at the top links to classification and
                            filtered searches for the place classification, as well as a link to
                            searches for manuscripts to be found in repositories connected to that
                            place.</p>
                        <p>Two maps are provided when available, one based on the coordinates we
                            have, the other from Pelagios Commons API.</p>
                        <p>The item navigation bar will also directly link to the places index
                            filtered for this entity.</p>
                        <p>The main data section provides information as it available, the relation
                            bar on the right additionally provides a list of churches and
                            monasteries of which we know about and which are related explicitly with
                            this place. Also a list of resources linked to this place in Pelagios is
                            added.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Persons main view</h3>
                        <p>What distinguishes this item view from the others is the presence of a
                            box with the core informations available: names, relevant dates, etc. </p>
                        <p>The item navigation bar will also directly link to the persons index
                            filtered for this entity.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Authority files main view</h3>
                        <p>These only contain the general information and the relation as above and
                            have no additional specific feature.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Text/Transcription view</h3>
                        <p>For manuscripts and textual units, you may have respectively a
                            transcription or a text available, more often just parts of either. We
                            welcome contributions in this sense, if you have content which can be
                            shared and has clear sources.</p>
                        <p>The text and transcription view is divided in three main areas, one with
                            the witnesses (for text), the area of the text and eventually images
                            related to it as well as apparatus, and the bibliography.</p>
                        <p>The first level of the organization of the text is used to paginate, but
                            you can always show the entire text clicking on "See full text". In the
                            area with the text the transcription will produce the features encoded
                            (e.g. red for rubrication, switching alternative reading, etc.) while
                            the edition text, if annotated, will have apparatus notes linked to the
                            side.</p>
                        <p>Each structural unit of the text may also have links to quotations of
                            that passage, to an alignment tool for different version and to
                            alternative versions if available. An info button will tell you more
                            about each.</p>
                        <p>If a translation of the passage viewed is available, you will see that as
                            well. If images of the witness manuscripts are available and explicitly
                            linked, the images of all available linked witnesses will be shown below
                            the text transcription and follow on with the navigation. There is
                            currently only one partial example of this however, and we hope to have
                            more in the future.</p>

                        <h3>Compare</h3>
                        <p>Textual Units and Narrative Unit, will have a button in the option bar,
                            linking to the Comparison view. This will print for a given Textual or
                            Narrative Unit, all the manuscripts which contain it with a summary of
                            their contents ordered by date. You will see the unit in question
                            highlighted to enable you to see where it occurs in the different
                            manuscripts. Under this you will also have charted information from the
                            manuscripts in this selection.</p>

                        <p>In most cases this view does not do anything yet. It will pull
                            information useful from the RDF representation of the data, when it is
                            available. Because the RDF only contains some of the information encoded
                            in the TEI, this is often nothing additional to show here.</p>

                        <h3>Syntaxe</h3>
                        <p>In this view we provide tool for the structural analysis of manuscripts
                            following <i>La Syntaxe du Codex</i>, namely a table to support the
                            identification of convergent discontinuities and a Sankey chart
                            summarizing the stages of transformation and circulation of a given
                            manuscript.</p>

                        <h3>TEI/XML</h3>
                        <p>This view will produce an enriched and explicit TEI file for interchange
                            and reuse.</p>

                        <h3>Relations</h3>
                        <p>The relations view of any item will produce a force graph of the entities
                            and their relations to the current one, as well a table of such
                            statements including statements which point to the current resource.</p>

                    <div>
                        <h3>Images Viewer</h3>
                        <p>For manuscripts of which we store and serve images, the images view will

                            This allows the creation of ranges which make the navigation of the set
                            of images easier, by linking a feature, for example a decoration to the
                            exact image. The information box in the viewer will also provide
                            additional information about the images. </p>

                    <h2>Indexes</h2>
                    <p>Some specific features of the records can be searched as such in the
                        database, with dedicated indexes dedicated to those who are predominantly
                        interested in these features.</p>

                        <h3>List of cited publications</h3>
                        <p>This is a reverse index of all publications actually cited in the
                            database. For each bibliographical reference you will have the Zotero
                            tag, and a link to the EthioStudies library and a list of all entries
                            pointing to this. Eventually, if you filter this by catalogue
                            bibliography, then you will have the same as the Catalogue list
                            view.</p>
                        <p>You can limit this list to a specific type of record (e.g. only Textual
                            Units). Clicking on the link which you find after each bibliographic
                            record in the item views, you will land at this view filtered for that
                            record only.</p>

                            text or in its description. For each place you will see each annotation
                            listed and grouped by record in which it occurs. Beside the list a pie
                            chart with the break down of the actual forms annotated is also
                            provided. You can limit to a specific identifier or to a collection.</p>

                                colophon or supplication</a> in the records.</p>

                            selected items. The full text of the titles colophons or supplications
                            is provided in the result list, with a reference to the element where it
                            occurs and a link to the resource. </p>

                            to a relative calendar date, for example for liturgical recurring
                            celebrations.</p>
                        <p>You will be able to limit your search by day or month and see in which

                            will look at decorations and their features only. The filters are
                            relative only to the selected features, reading the legends will help
                            you to figure out what you can filter. For example you can search for
                            all encoded decorations of a specific art theme, or search the encoded
                            legends. If the decorations are present, but not encoded, you will not
                            get them in the results.</p>
                        <p>If an image is available, you will also find a thumbnail linking to the
                            image viewer for that manuscript.</p>

                        <p>The same type of filtered search is offered here for bindings and their
                            features. Eliana Dal Sasso designed the encoding and the search for
                            binding features present here. </p>

                            information on their current repository and original location as well as
                            date. You will thus be able to see where are the manuscripts and in
                            which period they originated in which area. This is as always subject to
                            data availability, but if you are not satisfied with the data, you can

                                <li>If you are searching for Yāʿǝqob, you will not have a lot of luck searching Yaqob, unless some kind cataloguer has actually added it into the data as simplified spelling form.

                            just as you type it.</p>
                        <p>Little options, little trouble, very sintetic results, i.e. you really

                        <p>
                            <a href="/facet.html">This new faceted search</a> allows you to search
                            for a term wherever it is, and then drill down the results, as in a
                            commercial website. Once your hits have been retrieved you can select
                            the features which help you restrict to a set of results. Beware,
                            however, because not everything can be indexed as text. if you search
                            for "Mary", you will not match all instances, but just those where Mary
                            is written up in the text. In most cases, this is not the case, as we
                            prefer where possible to use a pointer and store the name in an
                            authority file only. It is true that you will match that person file,
                            and from there you can navigate, and check occurrences and attestations
                            of a given person, for example. In this search, we are not trying to
                            give you sliders and similar things, or format the contents, or filter
                            out dirty data, you have to declaratively select among the available
                            values, for types of decorations as for dates.</p>

                        <h3>General search</h3>
                        <p>The general search offers a series of filters which affect all records,
                            which are all in TEI. You can narrow down to one or some of the types
                            and you can apply multiple filters. The info boxes will also support the
                            use of this search functionality.</p>
                        <p>As in the filtered searches, there will be some filters, which need to be
                            loaded before they can be used. You will have to select the type of file
                            and then select one of the filters.</p>
                        <p>The results will be grouped by type of resource and they will only link
                            to the entry, but some context will be provided for the first three
                            matches in each record.</p>
                        <p>
                            <a href="/as.html">If it is not only a text based search</a> which you
                            want to do, you may find some of the options in the advanced search more
                            suited. You can avoid searching text, which is one thing you cannot do
                            in other searches. But if you search for text, here you can additionally
                            specify which elements to search and restrict to a specific collection
                            beforehand, for example. Because the filters are offered for the entire
                            dataset, you may have to request them first, selecting from available
                            menus.</p>
                        <p>Examples:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <a href="/as.html?work-types=work&amp;keyword=Liturgy">Search works
                                    with Textual Units tagged with keyword 'Liturgy'</a>.</li>
                            <li>
                                <a href="/as.html?query=5&amp;element=measure">Search in the TEI
                                    element 'measure' for the number 5</a>.</li>
                            <li>
                                <a href="/as.html?query=Mak%CA%B7ann%C7%9Dn&amp;homophones=true&amp;element=persName&amp;work-types=pers&amp;relType=betmas%3AhusbandOf">Search 'Makʷannǝn' in persName elements of person records,

                                present.</a>.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>This page also includes special requests, like the one for role. Because
                            roles are assigned to references to a person and not in a person record,
                            this is not going to filter your hits to those which have a persName
                            with type role. It would not make that much sense. If you select a role
                            the engine will return you all references to any person with that role
                            and a link back to the records where they are mentioned with that role.
                            You don't need to hit search, just hold on and they will appear on the
                            right.</p>

                        <h3>XPath search</h3>
                        <p>All searches are XPath searches in an XML database like the one behind
                            this website, but what you can ask in a XPath query is much more than
                            any of the provided search interfaces can offer. So, if you know how to
                            write your XPath, and know the source TEI (available for each file, by
                            appending .xml to the identifier of the record) you will then be able to
                            see your results listed.</p>
                        <p>Here you can avail yourself also of the structure of the file, the relative position of elements, and the 
                        nested elements, querying across the axes.</p>
                        <p>Examples:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>

                        <h3>SPARQL Endpoint</h3>
                        <p>Parallel to the XML, also an RDF triple store is maintained by the
                            project. Here you get an interface to the SPARQL endpoint. You can add
                            your SPARQL query and see the results available.
                        The endpoint can be queried from other visualization tools like Palladio.</p>

                    If not, you have a number of other options depending on what you want to do.</p>
                    <p>Simply point to the general page (e.g. https://betamasaheft.eu/gender) or to one of the views (/gender/table, /gender/graph, /gender/page) or to the data at /gender/data. All these are stable links, they will not change. Their content will, these are not resources subject to versioning, like manuscripts, e.g., which can be cited using PIDs, but only visualisations of aggregates and queries.
                    </p>
                    <p>To cite a stable version of the specific dataset (/gender/data) which you used via its HTML view, so not the latest version and not that specific view, but indeed what you used in whatever way, you could save a copy of the data, in a format of your choice to Zenodo, and point to that dataset and its DOI,  which allows very easy versioning of the imported resources in case you need to update that deposit. 
                        The metadata would have to contain reference to BM as required by the CCBYSANC of the data, allowing non commercial derivates with attribution.
                    </p>
                    <p>If you want to cite the page as it looks when you are looking at it and with the data as it looks,  save it to the Way Back Machine with any of the available plugins and cite the web resource pointing to the version stored there. e.g. https://web.archive.org/web/20200812190615/https://betamasaheft.eu/gender/table/female, this adds to the declaration of when you looked at something the possibility to check it at that point in time.
